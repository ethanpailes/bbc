Implemented:

Language Features:
  Aligned bit fields
  Signedness
  Endianess
  Named Types

TODO:

Clean up Front End of Compiler:
  Add a --help flag to print out usage nicely
  The _pack part of the API is currently unsafe (does not do any
    bounds checking). I should rename it to _pack_unsafe, and add
    a version which does some bounds checking and grows the target
    array. In the mean time I will just define a size variable for
    each block so the unsafe API is somewhat usable.


Generated Methods to Add:
  _init to zero out all the array tags.
  _set and _get functions
  _append function which can append nicely to arrays (growing them
      dynamically).

Language Features:
  Fixed width fields.
  Unaligned bit fields
  Nested blocks
  Higher order types
  Recursive Data Types
    - Requires a change to the semantics of how blocks are introduced
        as new types.
  Named sumty tags
    - Allow user to assign text name to the tag number
    - User still needs to specify the actual number to preserve the principle
        that disk layout should be as clear as possible
  Fields as sumty tags
  arrays with length tag translation rules?
