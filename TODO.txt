Implemented:

Language Features:
  Aligned bit fields
  Signedness
  Endianess
  Named Types

TODO:

Clean up Front End of Compiler:
  Add a --help flag to print out usage nicely
  The _pack part of the API is currently unsafe (does not do any
    bounds checking). I should rename it to _pack_unsafe, and add
    a version which does some bounds checking and grows the target
    array. In the mean time I will just define a size variable for
    each block so the unsafe API is somewhat usable.


Generated Methods to Add:
  _init to zero out all the array tags.
  _set and _get functions
  _append function which can append nicely to arrays (growing them
      dynamically).

Language Features:
  Unaligned bit fields
  Nested blocks
  Higher order types
  Recursive Data Types
    - Requires a change to the semantics of how blocks are introduced
        as new types.
    - Requires case blocks, and some concept of nil for those case blocks.


Optimizations & implementation clean up:
  Text manipulation with Text rather than Strings
  Use langauge-c instead of plan-text manipulation
  Switch to tokenizing parser
